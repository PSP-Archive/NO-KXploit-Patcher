NO-KXploit Patcher by moonlight



This program will patch the firmware 1.50 (in RAM) to allow it to run normal pbp's.
(what people often badly call "1.0 EBOOTS").

The patch will remain resident in the firmware until one of these conditions happen:
1) A program crashes the psp, forcing you to do 2.
2) You restart your psp holding the power button or remove the battery. 


You can run/exit games/homebrews, put the psp in sleep mode... none of those things will delete
the patch from RAM.


This program doesn't write anything to the flash, all is done in RAM, see the source for details.
